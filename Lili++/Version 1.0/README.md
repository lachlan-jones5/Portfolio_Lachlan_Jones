Lili++ is a C++ compiler project I am working on to improve my understanding of compilers. I am planning on using MLIR as much as possible, as my job utilises MLIR quite a bit, and it's just a cool technology overall.

It is going to be targeting Apple M1 CPUs as the backend, and will be written in C++ as well.

Earlier versions of Lili++ are going to implement a subset of the C++ language, just so I can have a fully working compiler quicker - this whole project is for my education moreso than to create a useable compiler, although a useable compiler is the final goal.
