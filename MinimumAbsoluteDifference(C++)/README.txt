- This program finds the minimum absolute difference of a sequence of given numbers in O(n log(n)) time.

- The log(n) is the sorting of the vector which holds the given integers

- The n is the loop that compares each member of the sorted vector to its larger neighbour to find the minimum absolute difference.
